# Variables
In programming **data** is stored in **variables**
* **Variables** store data in a piece of the memory
* Variable **read**: retrieve the stored data
* Variable **write**: modify the stored information
```js
let age = 5;
```

```js
age = age + 1;
```

```js
console.log(age);
```

# Data Types in JavaScript

* **Boolean**         
* **Null**

# Expressions
**Expressions** == **variables** and **values**, combined with **operators**
```js
a = b * 2;
// 2 is a literal value expression
// a = b * 2 is an assignment expression
// b is a variable expression
// b * 2 is an arithmetic expression
```
[/slide]

# Statements
Commands / actions to be executed
```js
a = b * 2;
// Get the current value stored in b
// Multiply that value by 2
// Store the result back into another variable we call a
```
