# Simple For Loop
The **For** loop is used for repeating the execution of a certain code known number of times

* The body of the loop **contains** a block with a source **code**, which is **executed** at each iteration

```js
for (initialization; condition; step) {
  //Body of the loop
}
``` 

Example: Print the numbers from **1 to 10**
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```
